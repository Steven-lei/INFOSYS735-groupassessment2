## Project Overview

This project automates infrastructure deployment using **AWS CloudFormation** for a multi-tier application setup.

## Objectives

- Automate the deployment of network and database infrastructure using CloudFormation.
- Ensure security and scalability by configuring VPCs, subnets, route tables, NAT gateways, and security groups.
- Deploy an RDS Oracle instance with secure credentials managed in AWS Secrets Manager.

## Modules

### 1. Network Template

This template sets up the core network infrastructure.

**Features:**

- Create a VPC according to the infrastructure diagram.
- Configure an Internet Gateway and public/private route tables.
- Deploy public, APP, and DB subnets across multiple Availability Zones.
- Set up NAT Gateways for private subnets.
- Configure Security Groups:
  - ALB: allow HTTPS (443) from anywhere
  - APP: allow HTTP (80) from ALB Security Group
  - RDS: allow Oracle port (1521) from APP Security Group
- Outputs: ALB DNS, VPC ID, Subnet IDs, Security Group IDs, etc.

### 2. DB Template

This template uses the Network Template as a nested stack and provisions database resources.

**Features:**

- Create an RDS Oracle Subnet Group using the DB subnets.
- Create a Secrets Manager secret to store the RDS master username and password.
- Deploy an RDS Oracle instance with the DB Security Group from the Network Template.

## Deployment Instructions

1. Deploy the **Network Template** stack first.
2. Deploy the **DB Template** stack, referencing the Network Template outputs as needed.
3. Verify resources in the AWS Console (VPCs, Subnets, Route Tables, Security Groups, ALB, RDS).

## Outputs

- ALB DNS
- VPC ID
- Public Subnet IDs
- APP Subnet IDs
- DB Subnet IDs
- Security Group IDs
